        2. Rotate 90 degrees clockwise(facing shipping depot), and drive through the bar until it detects shipping element
        3. Put shipping element into the team wobble goal
        4. Rotate 180 degrees and drive until the 2 touch sensors are touching the walls and the distance between the robot and carousel is (XXX)
        5. Spin Duck out of Carousel
        6. Rotate 90 degrees clockwise
        7. Drive into parking.
