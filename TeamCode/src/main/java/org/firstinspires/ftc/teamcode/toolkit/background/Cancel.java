//04.09 Understanding Satire Worksheet
//Part A: Twain and McCullough
//Provide supporting evidence from the texts (below) to support your responses to these questions. Use complete sentences in your responses.
//1.	What is the issue Twain is satirizing?
//-	Twain is satirizing the issue of authority figures and adults talking down upon the youth. This is seen by Twain’s exaggeration and emphasis on his desire for “instruction of the young.” Twain also continually discredits the individuality of the youth, a problem in society that he is satirizing.
//
//2.	What techniques does Twain use to create his satire?
//-	Twain creates his satire through the use of irony. While he is opposed to the commonplace idea that adults are superior to the youth and should give them advice, he does exactly that. Specifically, he states that the students should “be respectful to your superiors,” ironic since he is acting as their current superior. Twain also creates his satire through the use of Burlesque, the concept of comically exaggerated a simple message. Twain thinks students should think for themselves, but instead goes on and on in a formal tone about respecting authority and forgetting oneself.
//
//3.	What is the issue McCullough is satirizing?
//-	McCullough is satirizing the idea that children and individuals are special in a huge world. This can be seen by his repeated acknowledgment of “You are not special.”
//
//4.	What techniques does McCullough use to create his satire?
//-	McCullough uses verbal irony to convey his message that individuals are special and important, while he literally says “You are not special. You are not exceptional.” This clear verbal irony, followed by his numerous examples of why people are special, like “capable adults… held you… loved you…” and so on. These examples act as on overarching understatement about the importance of individuals. While he acts as though these acts are meaningless, the numerous amounts of them tells otherwise.
//
//5.	How effectively do the techniques used communicate Twain’s position?
//-	Twain’s techniques may have effectively communicated his position to some of his audience members, while others may not have known it was satire. While it is easy to analyze as satire now (because it is under a “satire” lesson), some of the live audience members may have missed it. Irony is a useful technique of establishing satire, but in some cases, it can be missed. More specifically, Twain becomes more and more serious as the speech continues, making it seem as though he does believe what he is speaking.
//
//6.	How effectively do the techniques used communicate McCullough’s position?
//-	McCullough’s position is effectively communicated by the techniques of verbal irony and understatement. Aided by the fact that his speech is relatively short and broken into concise sections, McCullough is able to grab the attention of the students and make them laugh. Not only can it be inferred that his audience understood his satire, but it can also be seen in the pauses of the speech. McCullough expects an audience reaction after he says, “You are not special” or “Because everyone is.”
//
//7.	How are the messages communicated by Twain and McCullough similar?
//-	Both messages involve the idea of individualism. While Twain’s message is that the youth should think for themselves and not listen to every person they hear, McCullough’s message is very similar. Specifically, McCullough states that the students should “exercise free will,” tying in the individualism aspect of his speech.
//
//8.	Which message could you relate to more? Explain why in a minimum of three sentences.
//-	I could relate more to McCullough’s message hjnbecause of his emphasis on the care we receive at a young age. I am truly grateful for all the help and care I have received from my friends, family, and community over the past 18 years and understand McCullough’s message that understates the importance of this care. I also related to McCullough’s message because of his humor that he infused into this understatement of numerous caring acts that children receive. It made me laugh and I understood his message fully.
//
//
//Part B: Search for Satire
//Use the guided analysis exercises within the lesson as a model for this part of the assignment.
//1.	Locate an example of satire. Copy and paste it here, making sure to note the source where you found it in a proper citation.
//(Possible sources include television shows, humor magazines, the op/ed section of the newspaper, movies, comic strips, songs, and internet memes.)
//
//2.	What human institution or human weakness is satirized in this piece?
//
//
//
//3.	Identify and explain the types of humor devices used to create the satire.
//
//4.	How effectively do the techniques used communicate the creator’s position?
//
//5.	Evaluate the overall effectiveness of the satire. Explain your reasoning in a minimum of three sentences.
