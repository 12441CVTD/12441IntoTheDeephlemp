A quick guide to the GamepadEx class

PROGRAM OVERVIEW:
Input class:
    This is an abstract class. It has a single (protected) method -> updateClass. More on what this does later

The Input class is extended by several other classes:
- Standard Button
- Toggle Button
- Variable Input
- Variable Button
- Toggle Button

    The last three items on that list are exclusively for the triggers.
    NOTE: This class does NOT provide any interfaces for the joysticks

GamepadEx class:
    This class resolves around a HashMap dictionary consisting of ids and input objects
    IDs are for user-readability purposes only. They can be set to whatever you want.



USAGE GUIDE:
- For an actual op mode, see the GamepadExTest in the tests folder.
1. First, create a new gamepad Ex object. You can have multiple gamepadEx objects to accomodate multiple gamepads.
2. Create an anonymous class with the desired input. An example is here
    gamepadEx.add("NAME IT WHATEVER YOU WANT", gamepadEx.new INSERT-THE-INPUT-YOU-WANT-HERE () {
        @Override
        public void run/onToggle(float/boolean value) {
             // Put what you want this input to do here
        }
    });
3. Call the update method in your loop.
