## TeamCode Module

Welcome!

This directory contains all the code used in Aberhart Robotics's Allen Keys team.

#### TeleOp

The `TheSebastianSpecial` file contains the main TeleOp code.  
The `TeleOpMain` file contains old code for controlling the robot.  
  
The `MotorTester` file is used to test each motor to make sure they work correctly.  
The `ServoTester` file is used to test each servo to make sure they work correctly.  

#### Autonomous

The `AutoOpMode` is a WIP of the code which will be used for the autonomous period.  

#### NOTES

To connect to the controller hub wirelessly: `adb connect <IP ADDRESS>>:5555`  
It should be `adb connect 192.168.43.1:5555` for our robot.
