IMPORTANT -- BECAUSE OF THE IMU CURRENTLY IN USE YOU MUST NAVIGATE TO THE FOLLOWING LINK AND
DOWNLOAD THE SOFTWARE FOR THE IMU
LINK: https://pdocs.kauailabs.com/navx-mxp/software/android-library-ftc/

AFTER NAVIGATING TO THE TOTALLY NORMAL LINK, CLICK LATEST BUILD AND DOWNLOAD THE IMU STUFF. AFTER
THE IMU STUFF IS DOWNLOADED, RUN THE INSTALLER. AFTER THE INSTALL FINISHES, NAVIGATE TO
gradle.properties AND AND REPLACE THE FOLLOWING PATH WITH THE PATH TO YOUR INSTALL. FOR MOST PEOPLE
ALL YOU WILL NEED TO DO IS REPLACE THE USER WITH YOUR USERNAME
PATH TO REPLACE: C\:\\Users\\YOURUSERNAMEHERE\\navx-micro\\android\\libs

BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW GRADLE WELL, EACH PERSON WILL HAVE TO SWITCH THIS EACH TIME THEY OPEN THE
PROJECT TO BE ABLE TO PUSH CODE. IF I CAN FIGURE IT OUT, I WILL MAKE IT SO THAT ITS A LOCAL PROPERTY
SO THAT IT WILL CHANGE PER MACHINE AND NOT HAVE TO BE CHANGED MANUALLY EACH TIME.
