 * This is an empty class which exists as the superclass of all control items and groups. Objects of it shouldn't be created directly unless for a good reason. The reason for a superclass of control surfaces is to simplify I/O. Input should be sent to an input location, which should then be handled by said location. For simplicity, this class exists to be able to hold multiple types of control surfaces in one field in a location without resorting to storing it as an Object.
