## Pipeline

This folder contains all of the files related to the OpenCV thresholding pipeline used to detect the location of the Team Shipping Element (TSE).

### NOTICE

While [tsePipeline](tsePipeline.java), [redPipeline](redPipeline.java), and [bluePipeline](bluePipeline.java) are marked `@Deprecated`, they are actually more viable than [greenPipeline](greenPipeline.java) and should be improved upon in the future.
