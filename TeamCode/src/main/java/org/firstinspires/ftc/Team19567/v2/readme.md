## v2

This folder contains all of the second qualifier opmodes.
These opmodes use Roadrunner (with DriveVelocityPID rather than feedforward control, as well as no spline movements) and OpenCV.

### NOTICE

***EVERYTHING*** in this folder is *outdated!* Do not study it, as a lot of the code in these files is inefficient and insufficient!
