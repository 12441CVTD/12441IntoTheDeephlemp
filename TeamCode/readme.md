### NOTICE
The folders [v1](src/main/java/org/firstinspires/ftc/Team19567/v1) and [v2](src/main/java/org/firstinspires/ftc/Team19567/v2) contain code from the first and second qualifiers, respectively. [Opmode](src/main/java/org/firstinspires/ftc/Team19567/opmode) contains the final code used at regionals.
As noted in the [top level readme](../README.md), all classes marked with `@Deprecated` (which will be ~~slashed~~ in Android Studio) should not be studied; they are not "final-product-worthy."
