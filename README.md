## Advanced rowland-hall-Robot Controller
This repository is based off of the FtcRobotController, and this is where all of our code goes. You can find the code that we wrote inside the `TeamCode/src/main/java/org/firstinspires/ftc/teamcode` directory. From there, there is another README explaining the anotomy and layout of the source code.

You can find the original README (for the FtcRobotController repository) [here](https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/FtcRobotController).
