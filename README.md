## IMPORTANT

I would like to thank @22jmiller for his help and contribution of the driving code.

This does have an error that I have not come around to fix **YET** and will be fixed when I make the commit labeled *Version 0.0.1*.

Most of the image processing code is located under the `org.firstinspires.ftc.teamcode.imgproc.ImgProc` package.
There is also documentation located there, which also includes the necessary `build.gradle` modifications.
