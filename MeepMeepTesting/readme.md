## MeepMeepTesting

Module used for MeepMeep in Android Studio. This is where Roadrunner paths are visualized and tuned. <br>
All of the Roadrunner sequences used in this module can be found in the files in [opmode](../TeamCode/src/main/java/org/firstinspires/ftc/Team19567/opmode), where more documentation is present. <br>
All of the markers in the files in this module have comments in them that detail what the actual Roadrunner sequences would run in order to tell what each marker does.

### NOTICE

This module uses MeepMeep v2.0.0, while [MeepMeepTestingOld](../MeepMeepTestingOld) is a folder that contains the old MeepMeep v1.0.6 java files.

### INSTALLATION

[This video](https://youtu.be/vdn1v404go8) explains how to set up MeepMeep. However, it **is outdated** and describes how to setup MeepMeep v1.0.6. It is pretty intuitive as to how to set up v2.0.0, however.
