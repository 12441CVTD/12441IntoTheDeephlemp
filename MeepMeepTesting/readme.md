## MeepMeepTesting

Module used for MeepMeep in Android Studio. This is where Roadrunner paths are visualized and tuned.

### NOTICE

This module uses MeepMeep v2.0.0, while [MeepMeepTestingOld](../MeepMeepTestingOld) is a folder that contains the old MeepMeep v1.0.6 java files.

### INSTALLATION

MeepMeep can be found [here](https://github.com/NoahBres/MeepMeep).
[This video](https://youtu.be/vdn1v404go8) explains how to set up MeepMeep. However, it **is outdated** and describes how to setup MeepMeep v1.0.6. It is pretty intuitive as to how to set up v2.0.0, however.
