# MathUtilsKt

Contains some math utilities with built-in casting.

Because I'm lazy, in the regular [MathUtils](../math-utils) class, I declared functions as `Number.function(...): Double`
instead of writing explicit overloads for each type.

This can get annoying because Kotlin doesn't support implicit casting, so you have to do something like this:

```kotlin
val c: Int = 1.clamp(min = 0, max = 10).toDouble()
```

This class contains most of the same functions, but uses reified types to cast the result to the type you want, often
implicitly. For example:

```kotlin
val c: Int = 1.clamp(min = 0, max = 10)
// or
val c = 1.clamp<Int>(min = 0, max = 10)
```

It's also really nice when reassigning a variable:

```kotlin
var c: Int = 1

// Some lines later...

c = c.clamp(min = 0, max = 10)
```

Currently, supported functions include:
 - `Number.toIn(from: DistanceUnit = DistanceUnit.CM)`
 - `Number.toCm(from: DistanceUnit = DistanceUnit.INCHES)`
 - `Number.toRad(from: AngleUnit = AngleUnit.DEGREES)`
 - `Number.clamp(min: Number, max: Number)`
 - `avg(vararg xs: Number)`
 - `maxMagnitude(vararg xs: Number)`
 - `maxMagnitudeAbs(vararg xs: Number)`
 - `Number.withDeadzone(deadzone: Number, origin: Number = 0.0)`

There's also an infix `pow` function, `Number.pow(exponent: Number)`, which doesn't support implicit casting, but
it's still nicer than `double1.pow(double2)` since you can just do `double1 pow double2`.
